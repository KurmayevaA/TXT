Notes:

This issue occurs consistently on all browsers and devices tested.
All other fields on the registration form are properly validated and trigger appropriate error messages when invalid data is entered.
This issue was not present in previous versions of the registration form, suggesting that it may have been introduced in a recent update.
Environment:

OS: Windows 10
Browser: Google Chrome, version 93.0.4577.63
Device: Dell Inspiron 15 5000 series
Severity/Priority:
This issue is of medium severity, as it does not prevent the user from registering 
but could lead to confusion and incorrect data being entered. It should be addressed 
with a priority of 2, as it affects a key aspect of the registration process and could negatively impact the user experience.
